# 42SH

## Description

Basic shell based on TCSH.

42sh is the end-of-year project for students at Epitech during their first year. Please, while you can skim through the codebase as much as you want, don't use any of the code directly if this project was given to you. On the other hand you are free to use the `local/42sh.ebnf` file and apply it to your project.

## Usage

After cloning the repository, build the executable as so
```
$ make
```
Then you can start the shell directly by using
```
$ ./42sh [--debug-mode]
```
